# One Dollar Bills 

## Description
Project contains realistic $1 models. The texture requires UV unwrapping and is uploaded to Blenderkit.

Some bills have subdivision, twist, bend, and displace modifiers applied to give a crumpled appearance.

## Scenes

### Scene 1
Swarm of $1 in a rigid body world. The bills are grumpled but have the modifiers applied already. Originally was a particle system.

### Scene 2:

A single faced plane with the $1 texture. Used to demonstrate the SSS and transluceny without the distortion from folds. It also is good for particle systems as it is incredibly low poly.

### Scene 3: 

A procedurally crumpled dollar to render a preview thumbnail of the texture. Does not have the procedural crumpling applied.
